      CogIST was established as an independent community that aims to bring
      fellow cognitive scientists living and studying in Turkey together so that
      it can provide a common platform for them all in which they can
      collaborate socially, intellectually and professionally, and to popularise
      cognitive science among all ages and backgrounds. As cognitive science is
      a relatively new field that is crucial for us to understand how the human
      mind works and how we can incorporate the ways by which the mind works
      into the uprising of AI. It is to say that cognitive science holds the
      keys to our future, yet so little is known to the people outside of
      academics, especially in underrepresented regions like Turkey. Hence, we
      declared one of CogISTâ€™s main missions to be spreading the recognition and
      popularity of cognitive science to people with different backgrounds and
      education levels. For this purpose, we have already organized events where
      we have brought authorities and enthusiasts together to create an academic
      discussion environment for ideas to grow. We also have conducted the
      CogIST summer school twice and uploaded the recordings online to establish
      a comprehensive introduction in Turkish for curious minds who have heard
      about cognitive sciences but do not know where to start to dive into this
      vast area.

      As CogIST keeps steadily growing, we decided to expand our reach and
      established The Cognizer with the same goals of making cognitive science
      more approachable to everyone, globally this time. The Cognizer is here to
      give any cognitive science enthusiast the possibility to share their ideas
      with their fellows who not only would enjoy and appreciate the ideas but
      would also be willing to challenge and improve them. As this is a founding
      stone in the creation of science, accessibility is a key concept in
      anything CogIST provides, as well as in The Cognizer. To keep our projects
      functioning as a bridge between experts and novices; and people of all
      countries, the publishments at The Cognizer are republish-free and are
      allowed to be translated if given proper credit. In other words, the
      publishings will be certified under a CC BY-SA license, meaning that the
      author can republish their work on a different platform later on and can
      freely have their essay translated into different languages, as long as
      they credit The Cognizer. As the spreading and the globalisation of
      information is our main concern, translation to other languages is highly
      encouraged by both CogIST and The Cognizer teams and we would like to
      announce and be a referee when a translation is published.
