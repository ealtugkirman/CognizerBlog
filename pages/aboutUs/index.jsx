      We are CogIST, a group of people gathered by our passion for cognitive
      science. Cognitive science is a relatively new field of study emerged in
      the 20th century and aims to understand the human mind, brain, and
      behavior by not only referring to but also combining, challenging and
      improving the methodologies and vast knowledge provided by its founding
      disciplinaries: neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, artificial
      intelligence, philosophy, and anthropology. As enthusiasts of such an
      interdisciplinary field, our team consists of people with diverse
      backgrounds, but similar mindsets and our primary goal is to reach out and
      help connect people like ourselves, i.e. people who appreciate cognitive
      science, regardless of their level of expertise. We managed to create a
      great community in Turkey, both socially and professionally to realize our
      aims. The Cognizer is now here to expand our reach to the whole globe by
      serving as a free publishing platform! We would like to provide a platform
      for you to freely concretize your ideas and publish them; as well as enjoy
      and discuss opposing or similar ideas regarding the content, the
      methodologies, and the future of cognitive science.
